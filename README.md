# Lagged-Alliance

Another Client-Side-Only game based on Three.js that I coded to learn about things like software architecture in JS, Pathfinding and WebGL.

Is currently put on hold because I have no idea what to do with it for now. 

Uses no other external sources except Three.js and chance.js (for random names).
